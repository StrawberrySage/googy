# googy (wip)
## Description

Do a quick Google search from the terminal.

## Setup
Simply download googy.py. That's pretty much it.

To search, go into the file's directory and run ```python googy.py <search query>```, replacing ```<search query>``` with what you would like to search.

## Todo
- Replace "select link" prompt with an actual command system
    - Allow user to go to the next page
